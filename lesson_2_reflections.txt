What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, an empty repository is created (or, if a
repository already exists, the repository is reinitialized). This step is
necessary because it creates the hidden .git file that Git uses to recognize
whether a directory is a repository or not.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediate area between the working directory and the
repository where files are stored before they are committed. Files that are
initially in the working directory are added to the staging area, then are
committed when the commit command is ran. This gives the user the flexibility
to add and remove files as necessary before a commit needs to be made.
