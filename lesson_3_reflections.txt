When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

A remote repository would be useful when the user wants to share their work
publicly on GitHub, or when multiple users are collaborating on one project.
Keeping all work locally would be ideal only when the user wants to keep all
their work private or when the project isn't ready to be publicly shared.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It's useful to manually pull changes in situations where a collaborative
project is still in progress and not ready to be committed yet. This way the
changes can be pulled when the project is ready instead of automatically pulled
during development, which could potentially cause issues.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is when a repository is cloned directly on GitHub and only works on the server side. This would be used when the user wants to add/modify another user's repository without having to clone the repository to their machine. Also, forking gives credit to the user that the repository originated from. Forking can be used to propose changes to someone else's project or to use their project as a starting point for your own project. Forking maintains connection to the remote repo and allows push/pull functionality, whereas a clone does not.
A clone is a direct copy of a repository. A clone can be made from a remote repo to a local repo (which will automatically create a remote called origin) or from a local repo to a local repo. This would be used when the user wants to copy a repository from one directory to another on their local computer, or when a user wants to copy a remote repo without the ability to sync to the original remote repo. 
A branch is simply a label that points to a commit. A branch is only created within a single repository and is used to create commits that originate from the main project but is independent of the project.
