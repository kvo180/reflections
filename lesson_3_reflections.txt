When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository would be useful when the user wants to share their work publicly 
on GitHub, or when multiple users are collaborating on one project. Keeping all work 
locally would only be ideal when the user wants to keep all their work private, or 
when the project isn't ready to be publicly shared.
