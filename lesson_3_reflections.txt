When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

A remote repository would be useful when the user wants to share their work
publicly on GitHub, or when multiple users are collaborating on one project.
Keeping all work locally would be ideal only when the user wants to keep all
their work private or when the project isn't ready to be publicly shared.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It's useful to manually pull changes in situations where a collaborative
project is still in progress and not ready to be committed yet. This way the
changes can be pulled when the project is ready instead of automatically pulled
during development, which could potentially cause issues.
